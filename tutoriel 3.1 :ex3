/**

 * 
 * Create a class named Billing that includes three overloaded computeBill() methods for a photo book store. 
a.  When computeBill() receives a single parameter, it represents the price of one photo book ordered. Add 8% tax, and return the total due. 
b. When computeBill() receives two parameters, they represent the price of a photo book and the quantity ordered. Multiply the two values, add 8% tax, and return the total due.  
c. When computeBill() receives three parameters, they represent the price of a photo book, the quantity ordered, and a coupon value. Multiply the quantity and price, reduce the result by the coupon value, and then add 8% tax and return the total due. 
Write a main() method that tests all three overloaded methods.
