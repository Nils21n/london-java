 * 
 * Write a class for an insurance company to determine policy premiums. The class should have the variables customer id, type of policy(health/auto). Write the necessary constructors, accessor and mutator methods. The method/s should calculate the premium for health and auto insurance policy.  The premium is calculated as follows:
The health insurance method asks users whether they smoke; the premium is $250 for smokers and $190 for nonsmokers. The auto insurance method asks users to enter the number of traffic tickets they have received in the last three years. The premium is $175 for drivers with three or more tickets, $140 for those with one or two tickets, and $95 for those with no tickets
Write the demo class that asks the user for the customer id.  It also prompts each user for the type of policy neededâ€”health or auto. Calculate and display the premium for both the types of policies. Do you need static variables or methods here? Can you apply overloading?
